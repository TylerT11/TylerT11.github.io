					<h3>Home</h3>
					<p>I have learned many things in computers this semester, such has proper finger placement on keys, photoshopping images, and 3D modeling.  First, I learned how to change images.  Photoshoping images are really simple and time consuming, as long as you know what you are doing.  Secodly, I learned how to creat simple websites using HTML.  HTML or also known as Hypertext Mark Language.  Once I got the hang of it I started to use CSS and Bootstrap. Next, I learned how to 3D model, and create games.  In this unit, I really took off, and became about a week aheard of the class.  During Parrcc Testing we took a break from the computer, and learned binarry and encriptoon.Binary is ones and zeros, and encription is a way to use secret messages.  Later, we learned about hardware, which is all of the parts inside of a computer.  In that unit we had to 3D models one piece of Hardware, and I did the Mother Board.  In this unit we learned about javascript, which is a very hard language.</p>
					<p>My goal for eighth grade are quite simple.  First, I would like know how we will use Geometry in everyday life.  I also would like to know a little bit more physics, and chemistry.  I would also like to run a mile in under 9 minutes, because last year I got 9 and a half minutes.  In my Language Arts class, I would like to read more books, because I do not often read books.</p>
